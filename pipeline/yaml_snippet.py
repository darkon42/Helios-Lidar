"""Render the ready-to-paste YAML block for the Helios card's
`lidar-local-ndsm-*` provider keys.

The URL we hand back deliberately points at Home Assistant's
`/local/` namespace (which maps to `config/www/` on the HA host),
NOT the helios-lidar.org VPS. The COG file itself lives transiently
on the VPS only for a few minutes after the job finishes; the
browser auto-downloads it, the user drops it under
`config/www/helios/`, and the snippet then resolves to that local
copy through HA's own web server. This keeps the VPS from
accumulating per-user output files and keeps the Helios card
working even when helios-lidar.org is down or moves elsewhere.
