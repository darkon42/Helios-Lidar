"""Rasterise a LAS / LAZ point cloud directly into a height-above-
ground (nDSM) Float32 GeoTIFF.

This skips the intermediate DSM + DTM raster pair the two-input flow
needs: we compute the per-point height relative to the nearest ground
point first, then take the per-cell maximum of those heights. Matches
the result of PDAL's `filters.hag_nn` + `writers.gdal` with
`output_type=max`, but in pure-Python on top of laspy (with the
`lazrs` Rust LAZ codec) + scipy (cKDTree) + the GDAL Python bindings
the rest of the pipeline already speaks. No system PDAL needed,
which sidesteps the absence of PDAL packages in Ubuntu 25.04 plucky
and the UbuntuGIS PPA's missing plucky release.

The implementation expects classified LiDAR (the standard 1 byte
per point with code 2 = ground, the ASPRS spec used by virtually
every modern national LiDAR programme). If a file has no ground-
classified points we fail with a user-facing message rather than
guessing a ground filter; that decision belongs upstream.

Memory: a 1 km x 1 km tile at 10 points / m^2 holds ~ 10 M points,
~ 240 MB resident as four Float64 arrays (x, y, z, hag). The VPS
has ~ 6 GB free RAM so a 50 M-point tile (~ 1.2 GB) still fits.
Larger inputs would need chunked processing; we'll add that when a
real input hits the limit.
