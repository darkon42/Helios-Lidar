"""Render the community-maintained `LIDAR_SOURCES.md` at the repo
root into HTML for the upload page's "Where do I download LiDAR
data" section.

The markdown file is the source of truth: contributors add new
countries by editing it and sending a pull request. The upload page
fetches the rendered HTML on load via `GET /api/lidar-sources` and
injects it inside the existing details block, so a PR that updates
the markdown ships to users the moment the new release is deployed,
without needing to touch the page itself.

The file is small (~1.5 KB) so we re-render on every request rather
than cache: keeps the contract trivial and the latency negligible.
